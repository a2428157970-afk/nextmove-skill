# Next Task

## Status

Epic-023 is complete. NextMove v0.8.0 is Developer Preview Ready with aligned
release documentation, explicit Skill and CLI entrypoints, preserved legacy
manifest compatibility, and an evidence-based Agent compatibility record.

## Recommended Next Step

Review the final validation evidence and commit, confirm it has been pushed to
the intended release repository, and create the v0.8.0 tag only after explicit
human approval. Do not block the Developer Preview on unperformed ChatGPT
Agent, Claude, or Cursor invocation; keep those entries pending and validate
them from real post-release use.

## Notes

- Do not continue expanding the Application Layer until instructed.
- Do not implement `--job-description-file` before post-release feedback and a
  separate CLI input/error contract design.
- Keep `entrypoint` and `cli_entrypoint` mapped to `skill.__main__:main`; keep
  `skill_entrypoint` mapped to `NextMoveSkill.run`.
- Keep `career_analysis` ordered and fail-fast through the existing public
  `NextMoveSkill.run()` API.
- Keep `skill/__version__.py` as the only package version source.
- Keep the Product Application Layer transport-neutral and dependent only on
  public Skill contracts. It must call capabilities through
  `NextMoveSkill.run()` and never be imported by `skill/`.
- Preserve the fixed fail-fast workflow: `analyze_resume`, `improve_resume`,
  `match_job`, then `career_advice`. On failure, retain the original
  structured `SkillError` without exposing resume or job-description input.
- Keep Skill Core independent from backend, frontend, HTTP logic, file upload
  handling, prompt text, and AI provider SDKs.
- Preserve `AIProvider` as the only provider-facing contract and keep all
  provider failures structured through `AIEnhancementResult`.
- Keep provider instance lifecycle external to `ProviderRegistry` and
  `EnhancementService`.
- Keep `AIProviderSettings` credential-free and interpret its timeout in
  seconds only at an external application or provider-adapter boundary.
- Keep `CredentialProvider` and `ProviderFactory` abstract. Credentials remain
  opaque and externally owned; `AIRuntime` must return structured unavailable
  behavior when assembly cannot produce a provider.
- Keep future Provider SDK imports inside a dedicated provider adapter package,
  with integration and live tests opt-in only.
- Keep `OpenAICompatibleProvider` transport-injected: the Skill must not add an
  HTTP client, SDK, environment loading, or credential persistence.
- Keep `ProviderRuntimePolicy` credential-free and network-free. Default to an
  enabled provider, one generation attempt, and structured failure fallback.
- Keep `AIRequestContext` transient and metadata-only; never include prompts,
  credentials, resume content, or user-private data.
- Keep live tests opt-in through `RUN_LIVE_AI_TEST=true`; do not configure a
  live credential or transport inside this repository.
- Keep `ApplicationRuntimeAdapter` as dependency assembly only. Provider
  behavior, prompt handling, and AI calls remain in their existing layers.
- Keep `AIRuntime` transport-free and preserve
  `from skill.ai.runtime import AIRuntime`.
- Keep `AIExecutionMetadata` separate from `AIEnhancementResult` and free of
  prompts, resume text, credentials, and user data.
- Keep credential storage, environment reading, key rotation, and concrete
  transport ownership in the external Application Layer.
- Keep `UrllibHTTPTransport` standard-library-only and free of credential or
  environment ownership. Never log headers, request bodies, or responses.
- Keep `AIExecutionObserver` content-blind and `AIApplicationLimits`
  non-mutating. Live requests require explicit application permission.
- Keep live validation externally assembled and default-skipped; the repository
  must contain no endpoint, API key, or secret.
